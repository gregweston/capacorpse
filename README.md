Cap a Corpse is an HTML5 Canvas game. It is written in Coffeescript and Sass.

## Setup

To get Cap a Corpse up and running on your server, you will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) and [Grunt CLI](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) installed. From the root directory, run `npm install` to install the dependencies listed in `package.json`. Then run the command `grunt` to compile the Coffeescript and Sass.
